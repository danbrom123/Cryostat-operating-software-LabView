# Cryostat operating software LabView

Labview VI written to control temperature and sample measuring systems of closed cycle refridgerator (CCR) cryostat in University of Liverpool's mmmlab.

## Devices VI interfaces with
- <strong>Lakeshore 372 AC Resistance bridge</strong> - Performs electric measurements on samples and controls temperature via heater wire and PID
- <strong>3706A-S Keithley System Switch</strong> - Allows automated permuation of the 24 electrical measurement contacts available
- <strong>Arduino</strong> - Reads volage from Hall probe of external magnetic poles (driven from a separate power and computer system)
